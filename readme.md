# iRacing controls.cfg

This is a [010 Editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/) template for iRacing's `controls.cfg` file, located in the `iRacing` folder in your user documents.

To update a control's device, you can edit the `guid` property for each control listed in the template results. The `joyCalib.yaml` (located in the same folder) file lists the GUIDs (`InstanceGUID` in this file) that iRacing sees.
